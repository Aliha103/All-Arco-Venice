# Promotion System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Delete/Deactivate Options Missing**
- **Problem**: No way to delete or deactivate promotions from the UI
- **Solution**: Added dropdown menu with toggle and delete options for each promotion
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `MoreHorizontal` dropdown menu with toggle and delete actions
  - Added `togglePromotionMutation` and `deletePromotionMutation` in PricingTab
  - Dropdown shows "Activate/Deactivate" for non-expired promotions
  - Delete option available for all promotions

### 2. **Missing Booking Statistics**
- **Problem**: No indication of how many bookings and nights were booked during promotion periods
- **Solution**: Added booking statistics display for each promotion
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `getPromotionBookingStats()` method in storage
  - Statistics show: Bookings count, Total nights, Total savings
  - Added icons (Users, Calendar, BarChart3) for visual indicators
  - Statistics calculated based on bookings created during promotion period

### 3. **Cannot Create Inactive Promotions When Active One Exists**
- **Problem**: Error when trying to create any promotion while another is active
- **Solution**: Allow creation of inactive promotions, only restrict active ones
- **Implementation**:
  - Modified `addPromotion()` to only check for conflicts when `isActive: true`
  - Updated error handling in PromotionForm to show better error messages
  - Added proper activation conflict handling in `updatePromotionStatus()`

## Technical Changes

### Frontend Changes:
- **PricingTab.tsx**: 
  - Added dropdown menu imports and UI components
  - Added toggle and delete mutations
  - Changed query from `/api/promotions/active` to `/api/promotions` to show all promotions
  - Added promotion statistics display
  - Added promotion status indicators (ACTIVE, INACTIVE, EXPIRED, SCHEDULED)

- **PromotionForm.tsx**:
  - Enhanced error handling for active promotion conflicts
  - Better user feedback when trying to create active promotion with existing active one

### Backend Changes:
- **storage.ts**:
  - Modified `addPromotion()` to only prevent active promotions when another is active
  - Updated `getPromotions()` to include booking statistics
  - Added `getPromotionBookingStats()` method
  - Enhanced `updatePromotionStatus()` with better conflict detection

## Usage

1. **Creating Promotions**: 
   - Can create inactive promotions anytime
   - Can create active promotions only when no other active promotion exists
   - Clear error messages guide users

2. **Managing Promotions**:
   - Use dropdown menu (â‹¯) to toggle active/inactive status
   - Delete promotions that are no longer needed
   - View booking statistics for each promotion

3. **Promotion States**:
   - **ACTIVE**: Currently running and within date range
   - **SCHEDULED**: Set to active but start date is in the future
   - **INACTIVE**: Manually deactivated by admin
   - **EXPIRED**: Past end date

## Benefits

- **Better UX**: Clear management options for promotions
- **Data Insights**: See actual impact of promotions on bookings
- **Flexibility**: Create multiple promotions with different schedules
- **Control**: Easy activation/deactivation without deletion
