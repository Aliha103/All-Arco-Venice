    message: "CRITICAL ISSUE: Database migration for chat system failed. The drizzle-kit push command hangs indefinitely and doesn't complete the migration. Chat tables (conversations, chat_messages, chat_participants, message_delivery) do not exist in the database. This is blocking all chat functionality. Need to find alternative migration approach or fix drizzle-kit configuration."
